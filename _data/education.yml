    During my time at West Virginia University I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Management Information Systems Association* and *Theta Chi Fraternity* taking on roles such as *Philanthropy Chair* and *Assistant Recruitment Chair*.
